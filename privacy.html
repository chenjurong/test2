    <h4>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h4>
    <p> The Application does not provide an option to create an account therefore, we do not store
        nor have access to your entries and data. <strong>Your data are stored only locally on your
            device and all calculations are done on your device as well</strong>. You can optionally
        backup your data to Google Drive (Android) or to Apple iCloud (iOS). Your backups are stored
        in your private cloud space and we don’t have access to your backup files.</p>
    <p> We obtain your email address when you request support via email or customer support contact
        form. We use your email only to contact you to provide support, feedback or important
        information.</p>
    <h4>Backup</h4>
    <p> We advise our users to regularly backup their data. Our users can choose to manually export
        the backup file and store it wherever they want or they can optionally make cloud backups.
        The cloud backups are kept in users' private cloud space where we have no access.</p>
    <p><strong>Android Google Drive Backups</strong><br> Android users can optionally backup their
        data using Google Drive. Their backups are stored in their private Google Drive space and
        count against their quota. We use a secure connection to your Google Account and data is
        safely stored in a folder where we nor other apps have access.&nbsp;View Google Privacy
        Policy at <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>
    </p>
    <p> The email and name permissions within the Android are requested in order to display the
        account details within the app to inform users about the account which is being used for the
        backups. The app does not keep email addresses and names within the app. The app asks Google
        Sign In for a connected account and displays the account info only when accessing the Backup
        section. Even if the user agreed to anonymous analytics data collection your email address
        or name is never sent with the analytics data.</p>

    <h4>Analytics</h4>
    <p><strong>The application does NOT collect any usage or crash reporting data without your
        consent.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p> If you’ve agreed to data collection, the application collects some usage data that are
        essential for us to deliver our services, to understand your needs, and to improve our
        services.&nbsp;Such as app launches, taps, clicks, scrolling information, in-app purchases,
        screen visits, session durations, or other information about how you interact with our app.
        These data are anonymized and aggregated from all users who gave us collection consent. If
        you've agreed to data collection, the application also collects crashes and performance
        reports so we can improve the stability and performance of our app.</p>
    <p> The application does NOT collect any user-generated content. Such as your name, surname,
        email, or anything you type within the app.</p>
    <h4>Photos</h4>
    <p> You can optionally attach a photo to your entry. Your photos are stored locally on your
        phone in our app's storage. If you choose to make a cloud backup (Google Drive or iCloud)
        your photos are transferred to your private cloud storage. They are counted against your
        storage quota. If you choose to manually export a backup file, the photos are included in
        the exported backup file alongside your entries. We have no access to your photos.&nbsp;Even
        if the user agreed to anonymous analytics data collection&nbsp;your photos are never sent
        with the analytics data.</p>

        ads providers.</p>
    <p> The iOS version of our app doesn't show third party ads. The free version of our <strong>Android</strong>
        app uses the following service:</p>
    <p><strong>AdMob (AdMob Google Inc.)</strong></p>
    <p> We use AdMob to display ad banners and other advertisements possibly based on your
        interests. AdMob uses cookies to identify users and they may use the behavioral retargeting
        technique, i.e. displaying ads tailored to your interests and behavior, including those
        detected outside our app. For example, if you've previously visited e-shop selling shoes you
        might see more ads promoting shoes or shoe shops.</p>

        relevant to you.</p>
